Patch 2-FP (First-Person ViewModel Core)
- Added ViewModelSystem: low-poly glove hands + procedural weapon placeholders
- Supports: primary/secondary guns (AR/SMG/LMG/SG/DMR/SR/PISTOL), grenade, class gadget, melee knife
- Animations: idle micro-movement, look sway, move bob, ADS lerp, reload pose, recoil kick on shot
- Viewmodel always renders on top (depthTest/depthWrite disabled) for FPS feel
Files:
- src/fp/ViewModelSystem.js (new)
- game.html (import + init + tick + recoil hook)
